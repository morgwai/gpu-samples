# GPU samples

Parallel reduction and [pointer jumping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_jumping) algorithms summarizing values from an array adapted to run on a GPU using [Aparapi](https://aparapi.com/) and [JOCL](http://www.jocl.org/) (frontends to [openCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/)).


## building and running comparison of various sync methods in openCL parallel reduction

First, make sure that you have an openCL driver for your GPU installed: [Nvidia](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads), [AMD Linux](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-amdgpu-unified-linux-21-30) (AMD on windows should be available by default, hopefully).

```bash
./mvnw package
java -jar target/pointer-jumping-gpu-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
This will run parallel reduction kernels using 3 different approaches to synchronization on
arrays of various sizes from 32k to 128M elements, 50 times for each size. On my machine it
takes about 5 minutes. For each size it will output average time for each sync method.

These are times I got on my integrated Intel GPU:
